Nemu's Electronic Entrancement Device

This is a clone of the [Cranial Lust](https://craniallust.blogspot.com/) [MUST/2](https://craniallust.blogspot.com/p/must2-information.html) system.

## Usage

By default, when the page is opened you will be given a form to fill in. All of the options can be left as-is except for the Playlist section, which requires at least one thing to be dragged across from Parts to List or else your trance will end the moment you start it.

The spiral section has a text box under the drop down. You can type in the URL of your own image here if you want to use a spiral that is not included.

When you click the start button, the URL will change. You can copy and paste this URL for linking directly to the trance you created without having to go through and fill out the form again.
